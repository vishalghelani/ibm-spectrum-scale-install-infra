# samples/playbook_cloud_remote_mount.yml
#

# Playbook sample for deploying IBM Spectrum Scale (GPFS) cluster with Remote_Mount
# enabled. Additional variables need to be defined for this, it is recommended
# to use Ansible group variables for this purpose:
# https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html#assigning-a-variable-to-many-machines-group-variables

- import_playbook: "set_json_variables.yml"

- hosts: cluster01
  collections:
    - ibm.spectrum_scale
  vars:
    - scale_remotemount_debug: true
  roles:
    - remote_mount

# If Accessing/Client Cluster don't have GUI,
# Then change wee need to add variable scale_remotemount_client_no_gui: true and ansible "hosts" need to point to one of the Scale client cluster node
